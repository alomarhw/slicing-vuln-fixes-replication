"""ResearchPilot run wrapper.

Runs an experiment script as ``__main__`` and then HARD-exits. Experiment code routinely imports
datasets/pandas/torch, which pull in PyArrow + OpenMP; their global thread pools can deadlock in C++
static destructors at interpreter shutdown on macOS — hanging the process AFTER the experiment has
finished and written its results. os._exit skips those finalizers. The real exit code is preserved
(so the runner's repair loop still detects failures), and tracebacks are printed for the repair loop.

Usage: ``python3 rp_entry.py <script.py> [args...]``
